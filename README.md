Against the backdrop of cultural popularization and scientific and technological progress, books, as an important carrier for knowledge dissemination, are increasingly prominent in their role. Thus, the urgency of building a bookstore management system is proposed. This system centers on electronic informatization and aims to restructure the bookstore management process through intelligent means. It realizes the transformation of book management from a paper-based to a digital approach, featuring simplicity, practicality, and strong reliability: The interface interaction conforms to users' operating habits, allowing non-technical personnel to get started quickly; The data persistence solution of SQL Server supports the storage of massive information and efficient retrieval; Reserved system interfaces can be connected to platforms such as the school's all-in-one card, enabling good expandability. This solution is not only applicable to the daily management of school libraries and class book corners, but its lightweight architecture can also be promoted to scenarios such as enterprises and communities, providing a reusable solution for the digital management of small-scale book resources. This initiative not only greatly reduces the workload of book managers and significantly improves work efficiency, but also creates a more convenient and personalized borrowing environment for readers through data-driven service upgrades, facilitating the digital transformation and sustainable development of the industry.
